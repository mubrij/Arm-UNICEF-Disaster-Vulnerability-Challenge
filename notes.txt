Not well explained in competition but nature of required submission explained in discussion
https://zindi.africa/competitions/arm-unicef-disaster-vulnerability-challenge/discussions/20371

imageid_categoryid   [count of that class in image]

e.g.
id_uawi0k5spci5_1	1  [count of 'other'=1 in image d_uawi0k5spci5.tif]
id_uawi0k5spci5_2	7  [count of 'tin'=2 ...]
id_uawi0k5spci5_3	2  [count of 'thatch'=3 ...]

So bounding boxes not required for submission, only to train something that can count.

Useful example Kaggle notebook referenced here shows can do with YOLO:

----
When conf threshold set lower, fewer false negatives, can I eliminate false positives?
o Now done Non-Maximal Suppression to hopefully deal with overlapping hits
o Eliminating very small boxes didn't help stats (didn't try with lower conf though)
o Aspect ratio: very thin buildings more likely to be animal shelters? But to get aspect
  ratio correctly would have to rotate to get width/height dimensions, maybe using
  segmentation to get proper shape
